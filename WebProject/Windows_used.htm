<h1>Windows used</h1>
<p>Perhaps you have already discovered the Windows pseudo folder inside 
 the Project Set-up pod. You may have tried defining a WebHelp window and 
 have grown frustrated when the attributes you specified were seemingly 
 ignored.</p>
<p>When your help has been called from a web page, there are different 
 ways it may be called. </p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><p>Simple URLs</p></li>
	<li><p>Using Map IDs</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If Simple URLs are used, the Web Application developer has the ability 
 to declare window attributes.</p>
<p>For a more detailed discussion on the different methods used to call 
 WebHelp, preview this topic and click <a href="http://www.grainge.org/pages/authoring/calling_webhelp/calling_webhelp.htm" 
											 target="_blank">this link</a>.

<p>There have been two windows defined for this Template. One is named 
 WebAppCSH and the other is named WebAppFull. The only time that these 
 windows will actually be used are when the WebHelp API is being used to 
 call your WebHelp. The WebHelp API exists as a JavaScript file. The functions 
 inside the JavaScript file are what makes CSH WebHelp work with the windows 
 we define.</p>
