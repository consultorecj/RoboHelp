<h1>How Applications connect to Help</h1>
<p>In an application there may be many different launching points that 
 open the help system. Each launching point needs to have a unique identification 
 number or be programmed with the URL to the page that should be opened.</p>
<p>If the unique identification number method is used, something called 
 a &quot;Map File&quot; needs to be created. If the simple URL method is 
 used, the Application Developer simply needs to know what that URL is, 
 so that s/he may create the correct link within the application.</p>
<p>Communication between the Help Author and Application Developer is crucial.</p>
