<h1>Screen Level Help</h1>
<p>When developing help for applications, it is often the case that each 
 screen or window is connected to a single help topic. That single help 
 topic describes the overall function of the screen or window followed 
 by a list of each field or area on the screen or window. The list contains 
 more information about the function of the field.</p>
<p>These types of topics are sometimes present in the help system, but 
 the help author doesn't want them to be found when the user conducts a 
 general search. <?rh-udv_start name="Version" ?>Adobe RoboHelp HTML 8<?rh-udv_end ?> 
 brings a fabulous feature to the table. The ability to flag a topic page 
 as being excluded from Search.</p>
<p>In addition to being excluded from Search, these topics do not typically 
 appear in the Table of Contents structure. Thus, no Breadcrumb Trails 
 are needed.</p>
<p>If you examine the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Project Set-up</span> 
 pod, you will find that a Master Page named <span style="font-weight: bold;">Screen_Level_Help</span> 
 has been created. This Master Page should assist in guiding you along 
 your journey of creating Screen Level help by providing a framework to 
 use.</p>
