<h2>Overview topics</h2>
<p style="background-color: #c0c0c0;">Overview topics introduce or describe 
 general concepts. They provide the &quot;big picture.&quot; For example, 
 welcome topics that orient users to your policy and procedure guide, online 
 manual, department guidelines, or specific components are overview topics. 
 They commonly appear at the beginning of a section or unit. Overview topics 
 can also include an explanation of information that follows, how to use 
 the information, safety warnings or precautions, and recommended resources. 
 Overview topics often provide more details than the opening sections of 
 decision/navigation topics. In fact, it is common to provide an overview 
 topic that links to a decision/navigation topic, which, in turn, contains 
 links to task topics. This structure guides the user from general information 
 to more specific information.</p>
